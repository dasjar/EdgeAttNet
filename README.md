![EdgeAttNet Architecture](./sample_images/architecture1.png)

Solar filaments are elongated dark structures observed in Hα images, carrying crucial information about solar magnetic fields and space weather events. Detecting them reliably remains challenging due to their fine-scale morphology and imaging artifacts.

We present **EdgeAttNet** — a **U-Net**-based segmentation architecture enhanced with **Edge-Guided Multihead Self-Attention (EG-MHSA)** — designed to accurately segment solar filaments while preserving subtle morphological features such as filament barbs, which are essential for determining the magnetic field orientation of coronal mass ejections (CMEs). By integrating learned edge priors into the attention mechanism, EdgeAttNet outperforms conventional architectures in capturing both global context and fine-grained details, while also reducing the number of trainable parameters compared to U-Net and U-Net+MHSA (with or without positional encodings).


Any questions regarding the model or dataset can be directed to Victor Solomon  (vsolomon3@studentgsu.edu).

## Updates Log
2025.08.12 &emsp; Initial release of EdgeAttNet model and codebase.

## Overview
- **Edge Guided MHSA**: A novel attention mechanism that integrates edge priors into self-attention for better feature extraction.
- **Parameter Efficiency**: Fewer parameters than standard U-Net and MHSA-based models, with faster training and inference.
- **High-resolution Filament Segmentation**: Optimized for capturing detailed filament morphology, enabling downstream analysis such as chirality classification and magnetic field interpretation.

## Methodology

1. **Model Architecture**  
   Built upon the U-Net backbone, EdgeAttNet introduces the **EG-MHSA** module, which leverages edge priors to enhance spatial awareness without explicit positional encodings.

2. **Preprocessing Pipeline**  
   Includes corrections for limb darkening and background interference, ensuring robust performance across diverse solar observations.

3. **Training & Evaluation**  
   Trained and evaluated on the **MAGFILO** dataset, outperforming baseline models including:
   - Standard U-Net
   - U-Net + MHSA (with and without positional encodings)

## Results

**EdgeAttNet** achieves superior segmentation performance while significantly reducing model complexity:

### Model Complexity

| Model                          | Trainable Parameters |
|--------------------------------|----------------------|
| U-Net                          | 31,030,593           |
| U-Net + MHSA (no PE)           | 35,231,041           |
| U-Net + MHSA (with PE)         | 35,362,113           |
| **EdgeAttNet (ours)**          | **22,658,891**       |

This reduction in complexity results in improved training and inference efficiency, as well as better generalization.

Additionally, the integration of edge priors removes the need for positional encodings, simplifying the architecture while maintaining robust spatial feature extraction.

### Segmentation Performance on MAGFILO Test Split

| Metric                        | U-Net   | U-Net + MHSA (no PE) | U-Net + MHSA (with PE) | **EdgeAttNet (ours)** |
|------------------------------|---------|------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------|
| *mIoU*<sub>pairwise</sub>    | 0.5724  | 0.5856                 | 0.6200                   | **0.6451**             |
| *mIoU*<sub>multiscale</sub>  | 0.5848  | 0.6000                 | 0.6601                   | **0.7032**             |

**EdgeAttNet** consistently outperforms all U-Net variants across both pairwise and multiscale *mIoU* metrics, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing both global context and fine-scale spatial features.
